## How to find the radial orbit instability of Saha (1991)

We are looking for the radial orbit instability in the isochrone cluster by scanning along the Re[omega]=0 axis for increasing Im[omega]. The key resonance is (n1,n2) = (1,-2)+(-1,2) so we'll pay special attention to those.

0. Design the model: potential, distribution function, and parameters, by building or modifying `ModelParamIsochrone.jl`.
1. Edit `run_linearresonse.jl` to include the list of frequencies you would like to evaluate.
